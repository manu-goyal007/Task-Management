## Project Overview
This is a **learning project** from my company training program. The project is a **Task Management Dashboard** built using **React**, **React Router**, and **Chart.js**. The goal was to practice building a dynamic front-end application, handling state management, and creating reusable UI components.

- Dashboard with pie chart showing **Done** vs **Pending** tasks
- Responsive layout with cards and shadow effects
- One-time welcome page (Manu Goyal page) before accessing main app
